<p>Please forgive me for invoking (spoiling) the words of Patrick Henry, one of the great thinkers and proponents of the American Revolution, who was no stranger to taking government officials to task on various and sundry matters, such as bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption. Anyway, I don’t understand politicians. I’m a computer scientist/hacker, and like many in the field, I cling to the hope that through technology and software, the world could be made better.  So on a recent business trip to Philadelphia—the same trip where I was accompanied by The Incredible Shrinking Access Device (my Asus EEE PC 900 series computer), I was a bit dismayed to see yet another public project that appeared to have gone awry: “free” public wi-fi in Philadelphia.</p>  <p>Now before anyone (or everyone) living in Philadelphia starts flaming me, I’d like to point out that I already live in a city where a similar project was to be rolled out (not free but at extremely low cost) that appears to have gone nowhere as well. So for those of you in the City of Brotherly Love, fear not, I still love thee.</p>  <p>So what is it that got me so irked about Philadelphia’s public wi-fi initiative? (suspense-building sound inserted here) Well, at least for a few hours, I had the unfortunate pleasure of being part of the public: I was in a public setting known as an A-I-R-P-O-R-T as opposed to one of Philadelphia’s hip districts, enjoying the hot new dining scene there.  If there is one place where people—including citizens of Philadelphia, mind you—tend to be where they might actually need free wi-fi, it’s the airport. Anyway, I roamed to about 5 different locations in the terminal (terminal C) and found no evidence of free wi-fi anywhere. I did actually find some evidence of a paid option being available but, alas, I could not even connect to this option—an option that was becoming more palatable with each passing hours as my flight into the Windy City was being delayed by stormy/windy weather in the area.</p>  <p>So I decided to do a little more digging and found the sad story at this <a href="http://www.wirelessphiladelphia.org/blog_detail.cfm/blog/64">blog</a>, and the following paragraph is all you need to read:</p>  <p>It has been well publicized that EarthLink recently announced its intention to sell its Wi-Fi networks and exit the municipal wireless business. Wireless Philadelphia and the City of Philadelphia continue to work together to explore options for the network’s future. In the meantime, we are committed to our core mission of serving Digital Inclusion customers with internet access, hardware, technical support and training.</p>  <p>Hmm, what does this mean?</p>  <p>I think it means a couple of things. First and foremost, EarthLink realized that this is a losing proposition for which they were never going to make a dime. And that little I do know about government projects, this looks like another classic case of an award being made to the lowest bidder, only in this case the bidder did not realize the hidden costs. Second, it’s another example of a feel-good project designed to appeal to constituents but—when it comes down to it—the city probably had not clear plan in place to finance. Free wi-fi ain’t free. You need something called infrastructure. Expenses for even a simple deployment can rack up quickly, to which any IT department in a corporation or university will readily attest.</p>  <p>Because of the enormous costs, it’s really important to identify a suitable pilot project and proof-of-concept. The City claims to have done this but by all accounts did not do the <i>right</i> pilot project. When it comes to wi-fi deployments, you really need to choose carefully. I would start with a large public outdoor space where the public actually gather. Cities like Philadelphia and Chicago have many such places. I’d also consider a large public (mostly) indoor space, e.g. <i>an airport</i>. An airport has one major advantage. There is an ample supply of people waiting around for long periods of time who will put significant demands on the network—a stress test, if you will. Coverage issues are non-trivial and replete with numerous dead zones. (I’m almost certain that I found at least one of them. But 5?) </p>  <p>I’ll conclude by submitting that we, the technology professionals, must increasingly broaden our interests to include business and politics. We believe in feel-good projects but are sometimes unwilling to guide others appropriately to understand the risks and hidden costs. I’m convinced that the project in Philadelphia is just one of many that hasn’t worked right or delivered the goods. Like many technologists, however, I cling to the hope that the day of ubiquitous affordable (or free) public wi-fi will come. I’m not quite ready to fork out US$40-50/month for a wireless broadband connection that I am likely to use infrequently.</p>  <p>So I apologize, Patrick Henry, but I am sure you will agree that I owe an even bigger apology to one of your contemporaries when I say that I have “not yet begun to…surf.”</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-8272629021240341545?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
