Because I’m used to being wrong, I found this new barebone system offered by Zotac, which is somewhat of a non-barebone, considering that it comes with everything you need, except for the OS. That is, you get the processor (dual-core Atom), RAM (2 GB), and hard drive (160GB). So all you need to do is get the OS installed. Armed with Ubuntu on a USB stick, I booted, installed, and had the computer up and running in under 30 minutes. Price: $299!</p><br/><p>These are not for those who do high performance computing or super intense graphical applications; however, this is a great system that has a significant amount of computing power for most of the tasks people want to do in an SOHO setting and in a small footprint, both in terms of power consumption (think green) and background noise. It’s not quite as silent as the Mac Mini but comes close!</p><br/><p>More later!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-3843954597621398510?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
