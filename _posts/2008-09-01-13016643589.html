title: We don’t need no stinkin’ requirements, or do we?
---

<p>I’ve been working on a small business venture in recent months, in which we are partnered with another company to do new (joint) product development. I’ve been in the middle of a heated debate with my colleague and our partner about whether we need requirements. The debate remains unresolved, oddly enough. Although a believer in agile software development approaches, I did happen to be around during what I term the “methodology era”, wherein companies (especially in the Fortune 500) embraced—at least on paper—the notion of a software life cycle that comprises distinct stages: requirements, design, code, test, etc. Of course, the software industry knows now what it knew then: The waterfall approach is inherently sequential and in most cases resulted in software that took years to complete, after which many development projects were either no longer needed or developed by more “agile” competitors. It is no wonder that the notion of agility became the basis for an approach, wherein software is conceived and developed in a more iterative fashion, or waves (as I prefer to think of it).</p>  <p>But I do find myself wondering, “Is there something missing in the world of agile methods?” I see a good number of so-called agile development projects that seem to eschew the notion of good documentation, both in terms of requirements and user docs. It strikes me that having a requirements document that undergoes some degree of peer review can be helpful to many of these projects, especially where there is a complex or less-understood business domain. Even for well-understood domains, it can help to remember what has been done right and make sure it is implemented in version 0.1. So (as an example only) if you are building the world’s next greatest web based word processor using agile methods—incidentally, there are at least 3-4 of them, some not so good—it might be time well spent to think about what makes a word processor a word processor and ensure key functional areas are addressed. I might be out of my mind but think that a software requirements specification (SRS) remains one of the most important “templates” for outlining this sort of thinking.</p>  <p>So this brings me to my last point. The IEEE has guidelines/recommended practices for writing software requirements. It’s called the <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/830-1998_desc.html">IEEE 830</a> standard, which appears to have been last revised in 1998 (1993 before that date). So I find myself wondering whether this standard is still applicable to the industry as a whole, or whether at some level, there is an implicit acknowledgment (for an interesting industry perspective, see <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/830-1998_desc.html">this article</a> by Conrad Weisert) that it’s just too heavyweight for anything but the largest projects, perhaps focused on projects that will not be developed in-house. It just so happens that 1998 overlaps in time with the “Web 1.0 era” when, I believe, many were starting to question the traditional approaches to software development.</p>  <p>In conclusion, I think it would behoove IEEE to refresh the 830 standard to reflect the highly dynamic nature of agile software development methods. There is no doubt that requirements are important, especially when working with other companies and customers. It might also help me to end the heated debate of whether I (or we) need to do requirements. After all, if IEEE hasn’t updated it’s requirements for specifying requirements since 1998, it is no wonder that some question their importance.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-5558194153420335653?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
