<p>I sometimes wonder about academics and researchers in the computing and engineering fields, which has produced a great wonder that we now take for granted known as the Internet. Yes, even a good number of English-language publications find the Internet so <i>matter of fact</i> now that it’s no longer capitalized. (In fact, <i>internet</i> is in the dictionary, which would explain this phenomenon.) But I find myself not in awe of this great invention becoming passe but rather how many academics in our fields—who really need to have a public presence and be visible in the field—are unable to create, let alone maintain, proper web pages. In fact, many personal sites I see out there seem to have been written once, much like the way CD-R technology works.</p>  <p>As we all know, scholarship and impact are matters of ongoing debate. In our field, however, there is a growing belief that journals and conference publications, while remaining important, are not the only things that are important to have actual impact. In the computing field, software and other artifacts (often unrefereed but nevertheless referenced) are  paramount in importance. Your web page is one of the best ways to make these and other materials available (including your conference/journal papers, subject of course to the copyright restrictions) and, strangely enough, citable. In short, you owe it to yourself to put together a site that is well organized and focuses on your professional life. After all, not everything belongs on the internet, which is why people visit Vegas. (You know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens on the Internet might be in your search engine’s cache!)</p>  <p>At the risk of getting myself into some serious trouble, I contend that most folks lack the expertise to maintain their own pages in HTML. Even those who do (like me, having written a book on web development) really should not be wasting time on coming up with some whiz-bang theme and spending countless hours tweaking HTML and scripts that generate it. In most cases, a web site with a straightforward and consistent appearance will do. Your goal is to convey essential information. (I would argue this is true of most web sites but especially applies to personal web sites.) Your students will also thank you for it later.</p>  <p>More often than not, I see badly organized pages that clearly don’t take advantage of a content management system or an appropriate hosted solution. There are a number of routes you can go, depending on whether you have the resources to support it (or IT, as in information technology) locally. There are numerous open source content management systems out there: <a href="http://www.plone.org">Plone</a>, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, and <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a> are all excellent and easy to install.  There are also a number of hosted solutions. The one I use to maintain my own web site, <a href="http://gkt.etl.luc.edu"></a><a href="http://gkt.etl.luc.edu"></a><a href="http://gkt.etl.luc.edu"><a href="http://gkt.etl.luc.edu">http://gkt.etl.luc.edu</a></a>, is a relatively new service offered by Google, and it is free for academics. (You’ll need to get your institution’s IT department or your own department to register, so everyone in your department can use it. You can also set up a personal account that comes with limited storage, but I would avoid this option.) You can maintain your web pages, navigation, and do basic customization of the appearance without knowing much of anything when it comes to HTML and CSS. You’ll also notice by looking at my URL that the site appears to be hosted at my institution but in fact is hosted virtually at Google. While there is the possibility that I’d eventually return to a department-hosted solution (we do actually support Plone locally), there is much to like about having Google host it for me. For one thing, my site can take advantage of Google’s search capability. (For example, try “parallel” or “XML” and you’ll find one of my papers in PDF!) In addition, there is something about knowing that my site is likely to have little or no downtime, given that Google stores multiple copies of everything in their data centers all over the world (distributed systems are a best practice, and most computing and IT organizations cannot compete with Google in this regard).</p>  <p>In any event, my point is the following. Whether you go with a commercially-hosted or self-hosted option is not important. The point is that there is no point in hand-editing HTML pages (and CSS) anymore, unless you are doing double duty as a graphic designer (or perhaps are doing research in computer art/music or graphics, where a fancy site might matter). You need to have a “less is more” presence that allows you to present a meaningful professional image and is easy to keep up-to-date. That’s what led me down the present path. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-4952918685312632292?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
