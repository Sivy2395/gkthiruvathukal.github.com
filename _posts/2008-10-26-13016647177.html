title: Enhancing Wiki Participation
---

<p>In a recent committee meeting at my university, the committee chair commented that he wished that more people on the committee would contribute content to our committee <i>wiki</i>, and even suggested that he thought most of us were not interested in the committee. Needless to say, I came to the conclusion that this is a topic worth blogging about, given that my use of wikis predates their being crazy, sexy, and cool.</p>  <p>By now, just about everyone reading this column knows that the wiki concept is behind Wikipedia, which effectively allows anyone to freely create, edit, or modify content(subject to some oversight, of course). Of course, fewer people might be aware that the concept was originally intended to support <a href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">software engineering</a> and the collaborative nature of requirements gathering and analysis.</p>  <p>The same technology behind Wikipedia has become more fashionable in the industry and among academics to enhance collaboration. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with web technologies, great ideas like wikis and portals fall into disuse (often within the same year). The common case I have witnessed is that the people behind the decision to adopt a wiki often become the only maintainers and—in many cases—leave it to the wiki itself to perform the actual task of managing. Until there’s a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence, humans will still need to manage other humans, especially if the end goal is to get something done at the end of the day.</p>  <p>I’m almost certain that I’m not alone in realizing that wikis aren’t always used effectively but have a number of ideas that I think can help to enhance participation and make wikis an integral part of doing a commitee’s (or any group’s) business.</p>  <ul><li>Consider having one person at each meeting take minutes, which can be composed immediately as a wiki page. I see many groups (including the one I’m in) taking meeting minutes in a word processing program and posting them online later. (It kind of defeats the purpose of a wiki, which renders HTML pages that do not require one to download, more often than not favoring the Word enabled user). </li>    <li>Consider prioritizing agenda items based on wiki participation, where folks who want to discuss a topic during valuable meeting time will get their items listed on toward the top of the agenda (when most participants are awake) with the maximum airtime. In-person meetings are often more effective when people take time to prepare meaningful content (and gather meaningful input) in advance. </li>    <li>Minimize paper by doing committee-specific work in the wiki itself and in real-time, if possible. In one of our meetings, I noticed that we were using hand-written comments (on printed forms) to evaluate a vendor solution—something that could have easily been done on a single wiki page, where you’d also have the advantage of seeing the previous comments (before making your own). Wikis can help to generate meaningful consensus and synthesis, not to mention eliminating the painstaking process of transcribing comments from multiple sources. Hand writing is bad, but having multiple documents or forms that contain duplicate information is even harder to synthesize. </li>    <li>Make sure all members of your group understand wiki technology and its core abstractions. Believe it or not, most people don’t. Although some wikis are easy to use (Wikipedia being one of them), not all have been designed with ease-of-use in mind. And the reality is that as easy as web-based editing is, some people still take comfort in the good ole word processor—even in the technology field, the word processor is like comfort food. It may be years before it is displaced, which probably explains the prevalence of web based word processors, such as Google Documents, Zoho, and Microsoft Office Life. </li>    <li>Make sure everyone subscribes to wiki site changes. Believe it or not, e-mail remains the most used application in the internet era, especially in academic circles. I know more than a handful of people whose work has degenerated to r/w access to e-mail. When you get a notification that the site has changed, your first instinct might be to ignore it. But as wikis grow in use, eventually someone posts on a topic you truly care about. Not long afterwards, you’re notified. And then, you post changes to that page or comments. Wikis are intended to be dynamic systems, and e-mail represents the “push technology” that springs us into action. </li>    <li>Finally, emphasize at every step of the way that wikis are not web sites but could be someday. In many failed wikis, I see folks who spend way too much time thinking about having the pages and navigation organized perfectly, not to mention wordsmithing things to death. What we want is to encourage the topics, content, and feedback thereupon to come in. Then we can make periodic adjustments. It is often necessary (while we’re on this topic) for a few folks to play a lead (editorial) role in rebalancing the wiki from time to time to make sure the group doesn’t completely lose focus. But an emphasis on perfection from the beginning almost inevitably ends in non-participation. Pardon the bad business cliche: Better is often the enemy of the good, which holds true especially in the wiki world. (No wonder Wikipedia is so popular. It mirrors our imperfection, so we can live with it!) </li> </ul><p>I hope these tips will help you to organize your own efforts. I see human productvity as the great unresolved challenge in our field and one that cannot be left entirely to proprietary solutions (like office “productivity” software). Wikis are helping some folks to be more productive, yet there are many who continued to be baflled by this technology. As I see it, this owes largely to a preponderance of companies and individuals who don’t place a premium on writing. I like writing, so I find wikis tremendously empowering. Those who don’t like writing might not share my sentiments. So I would urge all companies and organizations to consider not only adopting wiki technology but also embracing the importance of written communication. It’s easier said than done but, I think will lead to a virtuous upward spiral in terms of productivity and team building.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-3572467815796944797?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
