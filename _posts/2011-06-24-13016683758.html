title: XAVB501 Network Performance
---

<p>I just recently purchased the Netgear XAVB501 ethernet over power adapter<br/>to improve network performance in my town home. Owing to the way this house<br/>was built, it’s really difficult to pull new wiring throughout the house, and<br/>even so, I am not sure it’s worth the trouble. So I decided to give this <br/>device a shot.<br/><br/>Owing to my interests in high-performance computing, I decided to do a bit<br/>of casual testing using the <code>iperf</code> tool. I will stress that my<br/>results are a bit non-scientific, because I have not done an large number<br/>of runs yet.<br/><br/>Here is a look at the kind of wireless performance I was getting between two endpoints.<br/>To ensure maximum bandwidth, one of the endpoints (my laptop) is connected by<br/>Wireless-N, while the other endpoint is connected directly to a wired port <br/>(the Netgear XAVB501 in particular).<br/><pre><br/>lucky13:~ gkt$ iperf -c hub.local<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Client connecting to hub.local, TCP port 5001<br/>TCP window size:   129 KByte (default)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[  3] local 10.10.1.101 port 64776 connected with 10.10.1.110 port 5001<br/>[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth<br/>[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  32.2 MBytes  27.0 Mbits/sec<br/></pre>This is a wired-to-wired test, where I switched the laptop to connect directly<br/>to a wired port. Keep in mind that my use of the XAVB501 is not aimed at <br/>eliminating the use of wireless at home. The idea is to get an idea of the <br/>peak bandwidth possible over two of these gizmos.<br/><pre><br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Client connecting to hub.local, TCP port 5001<br/>TCP window size:   129 KByte (default)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[ 4] local 10.10.1.110 port 5001 connected with 10.10.1.117 port 64939<br/>[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth<br/>[ 4]   0.0-10.0 sec  68.2 MBytes  57.2 Mbits/sec</pre><br/>Without any kind of attempt to optimize my backbone, I’m seeing more than<br/>2x bandwidth in my testing. In fact, when I do larger transfers, the speed is<br/>about 3x the Wireless-N performance.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-9136508606734344033?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div></p>
