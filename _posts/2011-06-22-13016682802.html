title: Go, go, Gogo
---

<p>So I am returning from Digital Humanities 2011, where Steve Jones and I co-presented about our forthcoming book with MIT Press.  It’s great to see that airlines are finally (read: finally) starting to get it when it comes to wireless internet service. I had some work that I truly wanted to get done on the return trip home (San Francisco to Chicago travel usually means a loss of an entire day of work) and was delighted that my flight offered Gogo internet service.<br/><br/>At $12.95, it ain’t cheap, but I am on business travel after all and anticipate reimbursement. Yet the price is modest considering that I can do work and catch up on e-mail and news (ok, and some blogging) while being aloft. <br/><br/>Overall, I am finding that the service is responsive. For my needs, I am able to live on basic web browsing, e-mail, and text chat. You’re not encouraged to use it for multimedia and a/v calling, which is just fine, because I don’t want to be the person that I am usually complaining about who does those things in public settings. I’m happy to enjoy the silence.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope this service continues to be good and will become available on more flights. I really don’t enjoy flying at all, so this at least allows me to get stuff done, given that my head is usually in the clouds anyway.<br/><br/>For those who do travel more frequently than I do, it is worth noting that there is an option to go month-to-month or buy a one month pass (around $39.95). It seems so worth it for the business traveler.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-8010370024589746812?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
