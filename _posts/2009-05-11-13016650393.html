<p><p style="clear: both">I have been testing out this remarkable little tool from Microsoft. It’s name is a bit of a misnomer, given that it supports all of the open (or perhaps the better term is de facto) standards for remote blog publishing and is not limited to the less-impressive Windows Live blogging service.</p><p style="clear: both">The idea of WLW is not new, of course, but what I find impressive about it is how it downloads the styles for your remote blog and allows you to work offline. In addition, it makes life a breeze to work with different blogs hosted on different providers, making it much more of a win than saving drafts on all the different blogs you might maintain. (For me, this is a growing number, so I like the idea of being able to keep my postings on the computer and directing them wherever they need to go.</p><p style="clear: both">Anyway, I’m going to post a follow up to this, because I have since discovered other tools (for the other platforms I use day-to-day) that might be more appropriate for my needs. The Blogo program for the Macintosh (at $25) is impressive, and BloGTK 2.0 seems like an exciting new open source release in the making. (Unfortunately, I have to use GTK!)</p><p style="clear: both">Windows Live Writer, however, is very much ahead of most of the competition. Nevertheless, it’s mere presence should inspire greatness in others, meaning that blogging (and posting to all things social) should eventually become fun again.</p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both"/><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9123354412988433078-8317741870262153890?l=gkt-temp.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-3679119585979252770?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div></p>
