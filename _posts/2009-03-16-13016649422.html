title: Free/Open Source Project Hosting and Software Engineering Projects
---

<p>Every 2-3 semesters, I teach the Free and Open Source Software Practicum at my university, among other capstone and upper-division advanced project courses in software development. When I first offered this course several years ago at my university (initially bearing the magnanimous title of “Extreme Linux” but really being more generally focused on FOSS development), I thought to myself, “There must be someone else doing this already.” After all, on the internet, you have the ability to test just about any idea with a few carefully chosen keywords. When I approached Google Code’s project lead, Brian Fitzpatrick, about what I was doing with Google Code in my class, he wrote this <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/03/class-projects-and-science-on-google.html">blog posting</a>. (You can also grab my article in CISE from this link.) If there is anyone who knows what people were doing with Google Code (and FOSS hosting), he would be among those “in the know”. So, I figured, I must be onto something.</p>  <p>Just about everyone knows about Google Search and GMail but I think Google Code is one of the most compelling Google “products” in its own right, and it is highly useful for introducing many ideas of software engineering. Much like other Google offerings, it is free to anyone and sports a “less is more” design. Better yet, every project gets a significant amount of storage (1GB when I last checked, and increasing), which is more than most departments can provide on their servers for anything but a handful of student projects. And to my amazement, there is no advertising.) There are numerous features, including source code hosting (via Subversion), issue tracking, project documentation (through wikis and downloads), effort tracking (through an activity meter), and ad hoc collaboration. Although I am proficient in setting up most of these technologies on our own servers (and was in the business of doing so for years), the ability to do the same as Google Code in a robust, hosted solution that is well integrated is something to behold. And should any of my projects become wildly popular, I think Google is better able to handle the large number of downloads than my own institution (no slight intended but Google has the economics of scale working in their favor). With Google Code, my students can self-organize their projects, provided they agree to release any developed code under an accepted FOSS licensing agreement.</p>  <p>Although my course is about FOSS development and trying to emulate the process that real-world FOSS projects use, I find that the addition of project hosting sites like Google Code also allows students to achieve a “practicum” in software engineering as well and think that it would behoove many SE project-focused courses to do so. Many ideas of software engineering and the development “process”, for example, are actually brought to life through the FOSS development model and Google Code in particular. It is well established in SE circles that review is a critical component in defect prevention. Google Code provides the ability for the development team itself to comment on anything on the project’s site itself. The source code browser allows one to comment on code. This is an invaluable tool for doing code reviews and catching bugs before they’re reported. The availability of a customizable issue tracker, again, is something that allows one to do defect tracking, not just in terms of code but the entire “process” itself, which can be adapted by the development team for its needs. Last but not least, the project can use wiki pages to set up a complete project web site without spending an inordinate amount of time on trying to make the most beautiful looking HTML, which is largely a waste of time when the focus of the project should be on, ahem, the product and ensuring there is appropriate documentation (especially in an academic setting). Of course, Google also offers Google Apps for Education (another free service) which can be used for making even slicker looking collaboration sites—public or private. (I won’t go there now.)</p>  <p>While GC and FOSS project hosting might not be appropriate for all software engineering and capstone/project focused courses, especially in the unlikely event where your student project truly <i>needs</i> to be proprietary, it strikes me that at the very least it ought to be an option that is presented to students. I am convinced that student projects in many CS and SE programs tend to be part of a “culture of impermanence”. In an time where the job market is tightening (even for our graduates), we need to think about how every student can have a portfolio. Employers often ask, “Have you ever worked in a team setting?” or “Can you walk through some code or software you developed as part of your studies?” In most cases, my students can now answer in the affirmative to both questions, among others. In addition to student projects, I use Google Code for a number of my own projects, and I can track “interest” in my various works and focus my efforts accordingly. In the short time I have been doing this, I have seen the number of inquiries about my research projects increase dramatically. While I cannot guarantee results for you or your students, I think you’ll find Google Code to be well worth your time, and it’s actually a pleasure to use.</p>  <p>In the interests of disclosure, you’re not limited to Google Code.  There are others. (e.g. SourceForge).  Google Code, however, is one of the few that allows anyone to join (without special approvals from their staff) and doesn’t bury its users in advertising and has a clean, intuitive interface, and they seem to be committed to its evolution. Better yet, it seems like Google is trying to give something back to a community that has helped it to be successful.  I suggest taking it for a spin and welcome your comments.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-3472199425648314096?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
