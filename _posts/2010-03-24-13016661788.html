title: Computing Now has its own Android App, too.
---

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://multimediacommunication.blogspot.com/2010/02/computing-now-has-its-own-iphone-app.html">Christian Timmerer’s announcement</a> about the Computing Now <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ieee-cn/id355128762?mt=8&amp;uo=6">iPhone App</a>, I am pleased to report that we now have an <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.edu-luc-android-ieee-ttjt.aspx">Android App</a> as well. Android phone users simply need to go to the Market application and search for <em>Computing Now</em>. This app was developed by my research student, <a href="http://chicagoandroid.com/profile/MatthewWojtowicz">Matt Wojtowicz</a>, who has been working on mobile development for some time as part of his work on citizen-science applications in our <a href="http://www.luc.edu/cuerp">Center for Urban Environmental Research and Policy (CUERP)</a>. He was a recent winner of the <a href="http://chigtug6.eventbrite.com/">Google Android eco-challenge hackathon</a> in Chicago (the winners got free Android “Droid” phones!) so it was no surprise to me that he was able to rise to this challenge for our beloved Computer Society. </p><br/><p>Similar to the iPhone App, t<span>he application provides access to most of the Computing Now content on the iPhone and is also in beta but appears to be stable. (It even ran on my G1 with an experimental developer ROM, so <em>we’re feeling lucky</em> in Googlespeak.) Currently, it acts as an advanced RSS reader but is tailored to the needs of Computing Now, e.g., you may access <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/media#podcasts">podcast episodes</a> directly from within this application or get in touch with the CS president through <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cspresident/1/-/blogs/">his blog on CN</a>. As usual there’s always room for improvement and you’re able to provide feedback through a <a href="http://appserv02.uncw.edu/SelectSurveyNET/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=88L13560">survey</a>. Please find below a couple of screenshots or simple follow the link above to install it on your own iPhone or iPod Touch. Finally, it’s <strong>free of charge</strong>!</span></p><br/><p><span>We are using </span><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ieee-cn/">Google Code</a><span> for source-code management (yes, this is going to be free/open source so we can continue to maintain it with help from others) for this and other exciting projects in progress.
