<p>So this posting marks my debut on Computing Now: IEEE’s exciting new foray into the Internet.  It is a great pleasure to write this posting from an altitude of about 31,000 feet (about 10,000 meters), where I am unable to connect to the web (yet) to post it immediately. For as far as we’ve come and as high as we’ve gone, I’m mystified by the fact that a couple of rovers can <i>blog</i> (ok, it’s more like photoblogging) from Mars while much closer to earth, my device is silenced.</p>  <p>Nevertheless, I’m on one of the few business trips I have taken since starting to raise a family a few years ago, and I am writing this posting on my new <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/">Asus EEE PC 900</a>(one of a growing number of ultraportable computers). For the first time ever, I have a computer that I actually enjoy carrying onboard the aircraft with plenty of armroom. It features an 8.9” display and ways just under 1 kilogram at around 2.1 pounds. With no moving parts (solid state drive, SSD, or cooling fan) it is arguably the beginning of a new era in computing. While not the only product of its kind, and probably one inspired by the <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child project (OLPC)</a>, this commercial offering comes with Xandros Linux preinstalled, which is fine for those wanting to have a device for basic authoring and web access—almost all I need, especially when I’m on business trips. Of course, being the eternal geek, I decided to install the <a href="http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/">Ubuntu EEE 8.04 distribution</a>, which is the same as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.04 LTS desktop edition</a> but with all the needed drivers bundled and optimized for the smaller EEE display (smaller windows, smaller fonts, and fewer services started automatically at boot time). It’s the perfect setup for my ultraportable computer and all the more remarkable when considering that you can actually run a full development environment (for Java and Python in my case), not that I am going to do serious programming with this device.</p>  <p>Heralded by a Sony laptop executive as a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9879798-7.html">“race to the bottom”</a> because the price point (models ranging from my top end model at $549 down to $299) and performance are a bargain in the laptop market, the new line of ultraportables from Asus, HP, and Everex (just to name a few) is something to behold. (The MacBook Air is a lovely ultraportable but comes at a cost of 3x-5x the EEE based on your desired configuration.) As I am sitting here in coach, I am amused that both I and my laptop—neither being all that tall— can work comfortably together. Given the limited space on most aircraft nowadays, this incredible device is one of the few laptops that can actually sit on the retractable tray tables, leaving room for coffee and a snack.</p>  <p>Back to the future—and the subject of my blog—I see the this and similar competing offerings as the future of mobile computing or (perhaps more accurately) the way mobile computing should be. Most of us need portable computing as an access device but don’t want to feel deprived. Having struggled with “large” devices that provide way more than I need at one extreme and “handheld/mobile/wireless” devices at the other extreme that leave me wanting a lot more, ultraportable computers offer the best of mobility and sufficient power to do meaningful work. It has been said by many in the field (including myself at times) that Moore’s Law is “dead”. While likely true at the top end, Moore’s Law is no longer about transistors but remains important nevertheless in our quest to do things faster, cheaper, and better. It’s about how much functionality we can pack into a given space (per dollar) and understanding the trade-offs. You’ve gotta be excited about the future when you can get a laptop like this that is vastly more powerful, capable, and reliable than the offerings of just a short time ago.</p>  <p>Pardon the obscure movie reference: “The future is so bright, I’m going to need to get me some shades.”</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-6044892378518257756?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
