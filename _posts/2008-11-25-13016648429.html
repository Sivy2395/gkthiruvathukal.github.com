<p>Without a doubt, I must be showing my “middle age” just a bit with the title. Although I missed out on the fun of programming with punch cards, I still remember being part of the wave of CS students that was introduced to Dijkstra’s <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF">classic paper</a>, which was written a year or so after I was born.</p>  <p>We’re definitely in an age now, I believe, where the goto statement might be in the process of becoming one of the least of our problems. Today’s students are exposed to the virtues of formal methods, design patterns, and some such. Of course, it’s still possible (scratch that…easier) to write bad software, and we almost don’t get through a day without discovering some new malady, be it a bug or security/privacy issue. The optimist in me, of course, clings to the hope that we are making strides forward as a discipline to introduce a culture of reliable computing, even if there is still a lot of work to do.</p>  <p>To get to back to my topic, however, as readers of this blog (a growing number it seems, thank you) of this blog now, I try not to shy away from the hard issues. I try to practice what I preach, especially when it comes to curricular matters. In the past few years, I pushed our department and my colleagues to support a technical writing course that would be targeted to all of our majors in particular but could also be taken by other students in the university either as part of a minor or (more recently) a writing-intensive option. I’ve believed for a long time that the vast majority of software professionals lack the basic skills when it comes to technical writing. Collectively, this group is part of a “problem” that I call the “software comprehension problem” (for lack of a better term). Sure, technical writing is “just” writing. It’s a lot like writing an essay or a scientific paper, right? Well, not quite. Writing technical documentation is something programmers “just don’t do”. It’s often contracted out to others in many cases who just don’t do programming, so the programmers end up having to dictate how the program works anyway, thereby distracting them from actual programming. These leads to an impedance mismatch of sorts, where people who just don’t do each other’s kind of work, ehem, work collaboratively to produce a document that the users just can’t read.  In short, I felt like we needed to do our part to make sure our graduates can write proper documentation and were they to end up on development teams that contract the work out, they’ll at least know how proper technical documentation <i>should </i>be written. </p>  <p>So as always, I’m interested to hear from readers. As a discipline, should we be offering classes like this to our students? Should we make specialized courses like this available to others? Should they get writing credit for it? How should these kinds of initiatives be integrated into the curricular guidelines (e.g. those from ACM and IEEE)? Should we just make writing an integral part of the overall CS/CE experience? To all of these questions, of course, my colleagues and I answered a collective affirmative. We’ve been pleased with the results, and I think many of those employing our students are thanking us for it, even if it created some initial headaches for us as a department.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-1183272254097813646?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
