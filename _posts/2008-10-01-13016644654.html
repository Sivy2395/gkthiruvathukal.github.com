<p>I’ve been teaching about distributed systems for a number of years now. When explaining distributed systems in my non-geek circles, I’m sometimes at a loss for words for why the subject is truly important, especially when I see how most of the ideas find limited use in the real world, even now. And for those keeping score, distributed systems as an area has a track record that leaves a bit to be desired, yet it’s of vital importance in today’s software world. Remember distributed operating systems? Fault-tolerant systems? The list is a long one, and my colleague, Dejan, in Computing Now posted a bit about this topic earlier in <a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/home/blogs/grids-faded-in-the-clouds">Grids faded in the Clouds</a>.</p>  <p>As we all know, today’s infatuation is cloud computing. It will solve all of the world’s problems, or one would hope. Of course, it is precisely this kind of hubris that characterizes the technology field these past few decades. Yet one has to ponder the notion of cloud computing deeply and ask, “Can it truly deliver as a complete desktop replacement?” I think the answer is, perhaps, but there is trouble ahead.    <br/>So let’s take a look at a real world problem and how cloud computing addresses it. It is a problem I have code named, d-clutter (tm). Ok, I don’t hold the trademark yet but think I have a case brewing for one. Distributed Clutter is a problem that affects every one of us. I took a quick inventory the other day and realized that my computing life is, ehem, a classic case of self-created clutter. Well, this is almost true, my life has been set up in such a way that I’m increasingly nomadic. I have two desktop computers at the two different campuses where I teach and do reserach. I have three laptop computers (you’ve read about my EEE PC, the travel wonder); I also have a Mac 17” laptop (which more or less acts as my home desktop, given it’s form factor), a Tablet PC, and a Linux desktop at home. I tend to use all of these computers at one point or another during the week. To add to the mix of desktop machines, I have distributed clutter piling up on “cloud” sites across the net, which also don’t interoperate with one another. What’s a computer geek to do?     <br/>Here’s the problem. I tend to do development, research, and writing on these different computers. At least for the writing side, I am more often than not using a web-based word processor. The cloud does a nice job for me here—at least when the word processor is actually available. (Yesterday, there was a hiccup that prevented me from uploading my document. A nuisance, to boot.) But the cloud fails to help me when it comes to managing the local resources of my various computers? For that matter, what does it do to help me find private content that I keep in the clouds themselves? For example, I can install/use desktop search to find something on any given computer (using Apple Spotlight, Google Desktop, Beagle, among others) but when it comes to searching across computers, foggetaboutit (a word I picked up from some TV commercial recently and probably have transcribed incorrectly).</p>  <p>And this is where I see a huge disconnect between what we teach/research in CS and reality. Cloud computing may well be using some ideas of distributed systems behind the scenes, but it fundamentally presents a centralized view to the outside world, not at all unlike mainframe applications of the “past”. The good ole client/server paradigm is alive and well, just with new window dressing. But distributed systems remains largely underutilized for solving the most basic problems of distributed data management and synchronization (the right way to back up, I contend), let alone for conducting a private search across devices that I own. The cloud could have a serious role in all of this, I believe, by acting as a key bookkeeping service for all of our objects of affection. Even if those behind cloud computing really don’t want to store all of our data for us in its various incarnations, at least make it possible for us to find it.</p>  <p>The core ideas of distributed systems center around various forms of transparency. The desktop and cloud computing experience simply are not there yet, at least when it comes to transparent access to resources and data. It is true that this problem could be eventually solved by having a desktop that is always delivered to you from the clouds (remember thin client? the network is the computer?) and your own private virtual server. But this seems a long way off, especially when the internet providers are capping and shaping internet bandwidth. Furthermore, the basic notion of “always on” is at best a pipe dream (or pipes dream, as I often jest) so the mere notion of cloud computing itself, while catching on, will not achieve its full potential for years or decades to come.</p>  <p>I’d be interested to hear from you out there. (Don’t be shy!) For those of you who maintain 3 or more computers for your home/work/life, can you explain to me how you keep your data coherent and consistent? I haven’t played my hand entirely for how I’m doing it but hope that I can learn something from you that I might not be doing already.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4909373900263798053-2814684809711227357?l=gkthiruvathukal.blogspot.com" alt=""/></div>
