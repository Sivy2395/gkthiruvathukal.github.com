## Snail Mail Address

    George K. Thiruvathukal
    Loyola University Chicago
    Department of Computer Science
    820 N. Michigan Avenue
    Chicago, IL 60611

## E-mail

Please use [gkt@cs.luc.edu](mailto:gkt@cs.luc.edu) for all academic communication.

Please use [thiruvathukal@gmail.com](thiruvathukal@gmail.com) for all other communication.

E-mail sent to gkt@cs.luc.edu or gthiruv@luc.edu goes to thiruvathukal@gmail.com, so you need not CC my various addresses to reach me. Doing so may result in
a significant delay or *no response* to your e-mail.

## Telephone

My catch-all phone number is 773-829-4872.  I can be very difficult to 
reach by phone, owing to my busy professional and personal schedule.  If you
need to speak with me, please leave a voice mail with a clear phone number
where I can return your call.

You are extremely unlikely to reach my on your first try by phone, so if 
you don't expect to be available for a return call, please use e-mail.

## LinkedIn

*Graduating* students or alumni who have worked hard in my classes are encouraged to join [my professional network](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=588931) on LinkedIn.

## Twitter

Anyone can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/gkthiruvathukal). I am
not a frequent user of it, except when I am at conferences.

## Facebook

Please do not add me on Facebook. Effective January 2012, I will ignore most of these inquiries unless you are a friend in real life. I primarily use Facebooks for its *groups* feature.

## Computer Science program information:

If you have general inquiries about graduate and undergraduate programming
at Loyola University Chicago, you should first check the 
[general contact information page](http://www.cs.luc.edu/contact) for
the Computer Science department.

## Job Opportunities/Internships

I routinely get inquiries about *internships*. If you are looking for a job
I encourage you to visit the Computer Science department's
